							<p> Being the business owner of a 300+ employee company with offices in multiple countries, takes up most of CEO, Amit Gupta’s, day. Despite growing infoAnalytica over the past 8 years, Amit has always found time to devote to some form of fitness or sport. Running is his passion.</p>
							<p>Amit talks about how running simply happened to him and how in the process of being fit, he found something medicinal for himself. He equates running with meditation. It is his personal, intimate time where he gets to enjoy a cozy silence. Now a core pillar of his life, running is a time of day he cannot do without.</p>
							<p>The physical act of running much like other endurance sports involves know-how of nutrition, right gear and preferably accessibility to a coach or mentor for injury free sustenance of the sport. Amit founded 42.1 with the intention of bringing these three core elements under one roof. </p>

							<p>Khushboo was always a high-intensity short distance (4-6kms) runner until she ran a 10k in 2012 at an event in Pune. She was bracing herself for the last 2kms, ready to tap into the energy saved for the last milestone, only to realize that she had already finished the race! That’s the moment; she decided to prepare and run a half marathon. </p>
							<p>Her first half marathon happened in Ahmedabad in 2015, as a mother to an 11-month-old infant. She hadn't practiced much so could not finish strong but had achieved her goal and had fallen in love with running all over again. Since then, it's been a fantastic journey of self-discovery for her with a few more Half Marathons, one Full Marathon, a Triathlon Race and a variety of other running races. </p>
							<p>She has learned a lot about herself and some bit in general about endurance sports, and she looks forward to continuing learning through her association with 42.1. </p>

							<p>The fastest Ironman in the state of Gujarat, our Chief Mentor, Ingit Anand is a four-time Ironman Finisher. He is not only the first Ironman but also the first Certified Ironman Coach from Ahmedabad. Post his Masters from CEPT, Ingit worked in large scale multinationals in Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata. Currently, Ingit is a project management professional working with a real estate developer based in Ahmedabad.</p>
							<p>Fitness has been his passion since 2001, essentially since the completion of his school studies. After training in a gym for more than 15 years, an endurance sport paved the way for him to explore other dimensions of fitness. A dream of becoming an Ironman led him to foray into the world of triathlons and structured training in May 2016. After a few stints in India, Ingit completed his first Ironman race in Langkawi, Malaysia and he has not looked back since. </p>
							<p>Since then he fell in love with the sport and pursued certification courses to become an Ironman/Endurance Sport Coach. His favorite way to stay fit and healthy is Strength Training in the gym, which was, is and will always be his first love.</p>

							<p>Anand is a father of a naughty monkey, 2-time Ironman, Super Randonneur, Marathoner and a Fitness Consultant.  An inspiration to many, Anand underwent a remarkable journey from being a 'squishy around the edges' 30-year-old couch potato who loved fast food to racing an Ironman (twice) in 5 years! </p>
							<p>As per him, the toughest part of the journey was the 'start.' Every morning the mind has an excuse to skip this 'start'. He knows because he has been there and done that. He is here to help 'starters' get moving. To help them get through their "starting trouble." </p>
							<p>As Anand says, "you don't need any expert advice, all you need is a voice that will egg you on when you don't want to." At 42.1, he wants to be that voice.</p>

							<p>Rated as the top cyclist in the city and, being a professional cyclist himself, Yagnesh also coaches at Yoska, and, founded a Cycling Racing team, ‘Amdavad Crankmeisters’ in Ahmedabad. </p>
							<p>Cycling happened to Yagnesh during his years at Bangalore, and once he shifted back to Ahmedabad, the occasional cycling workouts gave way to regular practice, unstructured at first but a far more disciplined training (under a reputed Ironman Coach Deepak Raj).</p>
							<p>He’s founded ‘Amdavad Crankmeisters’ with his triathlete friends (who are triathletes and athletes) and won numerous races (Mass starts and Time Trials), long-distance brevets and, nearly missed out on becoming the fastest rider to complete a BRM 200! Yagnesh has qualified for state cycling championships three years in a row and also made it to the national road cycling championships in 2018. </p>
							<p>Apart from winning numerous races, Yagnesh has also qualified for the coveted ‘Race Across America’ and won ‘Silver’ at ‘The Deccan Cliffhanger 643 km Ultra Race’, known as India’s toughest endurance race. </p>
							<p>Waking up every morning with the same emotion of a little kid of the yore besotted with his bike, Yagnesh attributes all his success to structured training and curated nutrition.</p>
